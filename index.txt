            <b>Commodore Nutt </b>(April 1, 1848 â€“ May 25, 1881) was an American entertainer. He was born <b>George Washington Morrison Nutt </b>in New Hampshire. He was a midget. In 1861, he was touring New England with a circus when P. T. Barnum hired him to appear at the American Museum in New York City. Barnum gave Nutt the stage name Commodore Nutt, a wardrobe that included naval uniforms, and a miniature carriage in the shape of an English walnut. Nutt became one of the Museum's major attractions.
